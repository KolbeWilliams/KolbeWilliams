My work surrounds computer networks, network security, and programming with Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Assembly, HTML, CSS, SQL, and other languages. However, I am most proficient in Python. Many of my projects are reflections of my research in areas such as computer networks, security, and machine learning/AI.
